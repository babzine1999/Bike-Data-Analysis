# Bike-Data-Analysis

Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to determine the average income according to gender, marital status whether or not they bought a bike, the distance traveled by individuals whether or not they bought a bike, and the age group of individuals whether or not they bought a bike.

# Project Steps:
#### 1.Data Importation:

Data on bike trips was imported into Excel.
#### 2.Data Cleaning:

The data was cleaned by removing errors and duplicates.
Text values were standardized to make the data meaningful. For example, M for married, S for single, F for female, and M for male.
#### 3.Data Processing:

The data was processed to group ages into three distinct categories: "adolescent," "middle-aged adult," and "elderly."
#### 4.Data Analysis:

Analyses were conducted to determine the average income by gender, marital status, distance traveled, and age group of individuals whether or not they bought a bike.
#### 5.Creation of Pivot Tables:

Four pivot tables were created to visualize and summarize the data dynamically.
The pivot tables were named appropriately for easy reference.
# Deliverables:
  #### Analyzed data.
  #### Four pivot tables to visualize the results.
  #### A report describing the conclusions and insights drawn from the analysis.
 
# Conclusion:
The project helped understand the trends and characteristics of bike users based on different factors such as gender, marital status, age, and distance traveled. The results can be used to make informed decisions in areas such as marketing, product planning, and service improvement.
